    %
    %   Note: the worm's contour is still rough, especially at any split ends.
    %         Therefore, index lengths, as opposed to chain-code lengths, are
    %         used as the distance metric over the worm's contour.
    %
    %   Inputs:
    %       contour     - the clockwise, circularly-connected worm contour.
    %       wormSegSize - the size (in contour points) of a worm segment.
    %                     Note: The worm's contour is roughly divided into 50
    %                     segments of musculature (i.e., hinges that represent
    %                     degrees of freedom).
    %                     Warning: before cleaning, the length of the contour
    %                     can vary significantly: from 1/4 its correct size, if
    %                     the worm is coiled up with its head and tail touching 
    %                     its body, 180 degrees apart on the coil; to 2 times
    %                     its correct size, if the head and tail are both split
    %                     by invaginations that reach 1/4 into its body.
    %                     Additionally, there are various permutations in
    %                     between these extremes. Therefore, we use carefully
    %                     chosen approximations that are fail-safe to within a
    %                     large margin. Moreover, we use several other tricks
    %                     to ensure we don't incorrectly heal false worm splits
    %                     (e.g., we check for a sharp concavity before joining
    %                     sharp convexities). But, we remain labile in extreme
    %                     cases (e.g., omega bends where the head and tail are
    %                     very proximal).
