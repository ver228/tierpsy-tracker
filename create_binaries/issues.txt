* Version 3.2 does not import correctly pyqt5 in OSX (https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller/issues/1874). I had to download and install (python setup.py install) the development version (http://www.pyinstaller.org/).

* Got some issue related with different versions of libfreetype.6.dylib.
I can check this using:
	sudo find / -name libfreetype.6.dylib -exec otool -L {} \;

I find that I had an old version of PIL, and pyinstaller was pulling libfreetype.6.dylib. I deleted that folder (I installed too a new version of pillow, PIL seems discontinued).

-note: this problem can happends too with the libpng library, in this case it was matplotlib, that is installed with an older version and pyinstaller pull that one for some reason.

* the hidden import h5py._proxy requires quotations ('') in linux/mac but not in windows. Putting quotations in windows will confuse pyinstaller and will not be able to locate the file.

* use the options --windowed in Windows will cause problems in any subprocess. There seem to be some work arounds (https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller/wiki/Recipe-subprocess), but for the moment I will just leave the annoying background screen in the application.

hiddenimports=['h5py.defs', 'h5py.utils', 'h5py.h5ac', 'h5py._proxy', 
             'cython', 'sklearn', 'sklearn.neighbors.typedefs'],

* For some reason the 'datas' parameter in analysis is not working. I have to add data to a.datas directly.


* I recieve a Intel MKL FATAL ERROR. Solution remove mkl from anaconda (https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller/issues/2175).
	conda install nomkl numpy scipy scikit-learn numexpr
	conda remove mkl mkl-service

* I recieve an error of a missing package 'future'. Just use:
	conda install futures
